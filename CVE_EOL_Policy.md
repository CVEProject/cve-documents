# 1 Introduction

The mission of the CVE Program is to identify and define publicly disclosed security
vulnerabilities for consumption by the computing community. Significant debate has occurred
within the CVE Program regarding whether [CVE Records](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/FAQs#pc_cve_recordswhat_is_cve_record) should be assigned for End-of-Life
(EOL) products. This document is the result of those conversations. The purpose of this
document is to establish a policy and detail a process by which the equities of all program
participants can be aligned, consistent with the CVE Program’s mission. 

# 2 Background 

A Vendor [CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)](https://www.cve.org/ProgramOrganization/CNAs) assigns [CVE IDs](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/FAQs#pc_cve_id_requestswhat_is_cve_id) and publishes CVE Records for
products within their distinct, agreed upon program scope. Many Vendor CNAs treat CVE IDs
as part of product vulnerability response and remediation processes, i.e., CVE IDs are assigned
as product vulnerability fixes are published. Vendors do not typically produce fixes for products
that they no longer support. Vendor CNAs may choose not to investigate or attempt to reproduce
vulnerabilities reported in EOL products. Such an investigation may be cost-prohibitive, if not
impossible. Vendor CNAs can declare that products listed in a CVE Record are EOL and take no
further action. The CVE Program facilitates this declaration through the use of the CVE EOL
tag and educational documentation on the [CVE website](https://www.cve.org/).

There has been an ongoing, robust discussion within the CVE Program as to whether or not EOL
products should be assigned CVE IDs

Vendor CNAs contend that it is unnecessarily costly for them to deal with vulnerability inquiries
regarding EOL products, especially if it requires them to spin up teams to validate a reported
vulnerability in an EOL product customers should not be running. The problem is, to verify that
a vulnerability exists, the vendor would have to test and validate it. Many vendors do not see any
value in spending time, effort and resources on a discontinued product that should be removed
from operational use. Vendors would prefer customers upgrade to newer versions of the product
which are supported, rather than continue using outdated and officially unsupported EOL
products. 

Other CVE Program participants, however, believe vulnerabilities in EOL products should be
assigned because the vulnerabilities exist and users of EOL products should have knowledge of
how they are vulnerable, regardless of the efficacy of using EOL products.

Since legitimate vulnerabilities are sometimes discovered in EOL products still being fielded, it
is necessary for the CVE Program to have a documented and transparent process for dealing
with these types of reported EOL vulnerabilities.

While there has not been unanimous consensus among the [CVE Board](https://www.cve.org/ProgramOrganization/Board) members or the CNAs
themselves, there was agreement that the mission of the CVE Program is to identify, catalog, and
assign IDs to publicly known security vulnerabilities and that CVE IDs may be assigned for EOL
product vulnerabilities that meet the requirements outlined in the CVE assignment rules (which
are listed in the [CNA Rules](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/AllResources/CNARules)).

# 3 Temporary CNA Rules Inconsistency 

The [CVE Rules](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/AllResources/CNARules) v3.0, effective March 5, 2020, states: 

    “A CNA should list in their scope whether they want to handle CVE assignments for end-of-life components according to the end-of-life rules or whether other CNAs should assume that responsibility if they have a need to reference such vulnerabilities. If a CNA specifies that it will not assign for end-of-life components, other CNAs may assign for those components.” 

It should be noted that this is not required to be incorporated into the CNA’s scope statement at
this time.

The CNA Rules for EOL must be re-addressed, as the wording of the current rules conflict with
the agreed to process for handling EOL vulnerability reports. Below is suggested wording to
correct the existing shortcomings:

    “A CNA may list, in its scope, whether it does or does not want to handle CVE assignments for end-of-life components or products. If a CNA does not specify end-of-life handling in its scope, then all EOL vulnerabilities should be reported through the CNA’s official processes. If a CNA specifies that it will not assign for end-of-life components, then the documented applicable CVE EOL process should be followed. Top Level Roots (TLR) will define how the EOL process is to be used within their hierarchy.” 

# 4 CVE Program Principles

The following is a list of fundamental principles that should be understood by all parties
participating in the CVE Program, including CNAs, vulnerability reporters, and CVE consumers:
- CVE IDs may be assigned for vulnerabilities in EOL products.
- There are no expectations of vendors to either investigate or correct vulnerabilities
reported in EOL products.
- Vendor CNAs have the first “right-of-refusal” in issuing CVE IDs for their products, but
cannot stop the assignment of a CVE ID if deemed appropriate by the program.
- If a Vendor CNA does not assign, the CNA of Last Resort (CNA-LR) will work with
both parties (Vendor CNA and the Reporter) to determine whether or not to assign a CVE
ID to a vulnerability in an EOL product.
- CVE IDs assigned for EOL products are to be tagged with a *Unsupported When
Assigned* [tag](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/AllResources/CNARules#section_8_cve_record_requirements).

# 5 CVE Program EOL Assignment Process

The following section documents the CVE Program’s Default EOL Assignment process.

When a reporter believes they have found a vulnerability in an EOL product, they must follow
the process below to have a CVE ID assigned to it: 

1. The Reporter locates the appropriate CNA’s contact and scope information.
CNA contact information can be found in the [List of Partners](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners) section the CVE website. If
the documented Vendor CNA scope states they are supporting EOL assignments, or does
not specify, the Reporter must contact the appropriate Vendor CNA using the published
official contact information. If the scope states the Vendor CNA does not support issuing
CVE IDs for its EOL products, the Reporter will not need to contact the Vendor CNA and
instead should contact the appropriate CNA-LR for the hierarchy.

2. Reporter contacts the Vendor CNA
When the Reporter contacts the Vendor CNA regarding a vulnerability in an EOL product,
the Reporter is required to provide some means of depicting how the issue was discovered
and proof of the vulnerability’s existence to the Vendor CNA. It is up to the Vendor CNA
to make the decision as to how to proceed. Depending on the product and circumstances,
the Vendor CNA decides whether or not to assign a CVE ID for the discovered issue. If
they do assign a CVE ID, the process is complete.

3. Vendor decides not to assign
If the Vendor CNA decides not to assign a CVE ID, the Vendor CNA must notify the
Reporter of their decision and provide a reason why the decision was made not to assign.
In such cases where the Vendor CNA chooses not to assign CVE IDs and publish CVE
Records for EOL products, the product falls out of the Vendor CNA’s scope for the
purpose of CVE ID assignment and CVE Record publication. If the Reporter believes
there is a need for this vulnerability to have a CVE ID assigned, the Reporter can then
escalate the request to the CNA-LR to request the CVE ID. In these cases, the CNA-LR is
empowered to assign and publish if deemed appropriate.

4. The Reporter escalates the issue to the CNA-LR at the same hierarchy level
When the Reporter contacts the CNA-LR regarding a vulnerability in an EOL product, the
Reporter is required to provide some means of depicting how the issue was discovered and
proof of the vulnerability’s existence to the CNA-LR.

5. CNA-LR verifies the Reporter has contacted the Vendor CNA
Before a CNA-LR can take up the issue, and providing the Vendor CNA’s scope does not
preclude assigning for EOL products, the CNA-LR must verify the Reporter has contacted
the Vendor CNA. If they have not, the CNA-LR instructs the Reporter to do so before the
CNA-LR can proceed. The CNA-LR will request the email thread that included the
Vendor CNA’s response and their reasons for declining the initial request for a CVE ID.

6. CNA-LR confirms the Vendor CNA is not going to assign
If the Vendor CNA’s scope does not preclude assigning for EOL products, the CNA-LR
must contact the Vendor CNA to ensure the CNA-LR has a true picture of the situation.
Initial contacts must go through official channels; however, alternate contacts may be used
if initial contacts prove unresponsive. The response must come from an authorized point
of contact, through the CNA’s official channel. If the Vendor CNA has decided to assign a
CVE ID, the CNA-LR will redirect the Reporter back to the Vendor CNA and
5
the CNA-LR’s role is complete. If the CNA is not responsive in a reasonable timeframe,
the CNA-LR should proceed with the process documented below.

7. Determining the validity
If the CNA-LR confirms that the Vendor CNA is not going to assign, either by specified
scope or by communication with the Vendor CNA, the CNA-LR needs to determine
whether there is a valid reason a CVE ID should be assigned. There can be valid reasons
for a CVE-ID not to be assigned. Before the decision can be made, the CNA-LR needs to
obtain as much information about the issue as possible. The CNA-LR, as appropriate,
needs to take both the Vendor CNA’s, and the Reporter’s reasoning into account and give
each an opportunity to respond to the other’s reasoning. The CNA-LR will use the
information supplied by both parties in determining if a CVE ID should be assigned for an
unvalidated vulnerability. The CNA-LR will use the information supplied by both parties
in making its decision.

8. The CNA-LR’s Assignment Decision
The CNA-LR determines if there is a need for an assignment. The CNA-LR must apply
the [assignment rules](https://www.cve.org/ResourcesSupport/AllResources/CNARules#section_7_assignment_rules). However, in these situations, 7.1.3 must not be used when
determining whether the issue should be considered a vulnerability. If the CNA-LR
determines there is a need for a CVE ID to be assigned, then the CNA-LR will assign the
CVE ID, and publish the CVE Record with the appropriate information. The CVE Record
must include the Unsupported When Assigned tag.

9. Vendor CNA Notification
The CNA-LR will notify the Vendor CNA and the Reporter of what decision was made,
why it was made, and what actions were taken based on the decision.

#  6 EOL CVE ID Tagging

The *Unsupported When Assigned* tag (i.e., End-of-Life or EOL tag) is added to the description
by the assigning CNA to indicate that when a request for a CVE ID was received, the product
was already EOL. It indicates the CVE Record tagged with an EOL tag was requested and
assigned after a product or specific product line was deemed not to be supported by the vendor.
The vendor is under no obligation or responsibility to test, validate, or fix a vulnerability found
in a product that is no longer supported by the vendor. For the CVE Program’s purposes, the
EOL status for a product or version line is when it will no longer receive security fixes,
regardless of what term the maintainer uses to designate this status. Users are encouraged to
upgrade to a supported version (if there is one), replacing the product, or implement some other
mitigation.

## 6.1 Tagging Use and Considerations

While the Unsupported When Assigned tag describes the product ID (not the CVE ID), it is
applied to the CVE ID due to the manner in which CVE ID assignments are made. The
Unsupported When Assigned tag should only be applied to a CVE Record when all affected
products or version lines referenced in the CVE ID are EOL. If some of the affected products or
versions have reached EOL but others have not, then the tag must not be used. If the CVE
Record has both non-EOL and EOL products, the maintainers are not required to list the EOL
products in the CVE Record. 

CVE Records that existed prior to the product becoming EOL will not be marked with the
Unsupported When Assigned tag when the product transitions to EOL. The purpose of the tag is
to notify the community that a vulnerability report was received when the product was already
EOL and the Vendor has no responsibility to validate or fix the reported issue. 

The data publisher (Vendor CNA or CNA-LR) must provide a reference to the CNA-specific
EOL information, which typically informs customers how to upgrade to a currently supported
product.

Regardless of who assigns an EOL CVE ID, it is important to ensure the record is tagged
appropriately. An EOL tag is included in the description which is beneficial for the downstream
uses and consumers of CVE. Additionally, an EOL tag is indicated in the CVE Record tag
attribute in order to facilitate filtering and metrics.

## 6.2 What an Unsupported When Assigned CVE Record Looks Like

** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** [VULN INFO HERE] NOTE: This vulnerability
only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.

## 6.3 JSON Schema unsupported-when-assigned Attribute Tag

A “tags” property is a part of the CNA and ADP containers in the JSON schema. The value of
this property will be an array of string values. The “unsupported-when-assigned” tag will be
used when appropriate as documented above. 

For example:
```json
{

"data_format": "MITRE",

"data_type": "CVE",

"data_version": "5.0",

"CVE_data_meta": {

    "ASSIGNER": "cve@mitre.org",

    "ID": "CVE-YYYY-NNNNN",

    "STATE": "PUBLIC",

    "DATE_ASSIGNED":"2019-01-01 23:45:00+0500",

    "DATE_PUBLIC":"2019-12-13 08:45:00+0500"
},
"containers": {
    "CNA": {
        "provider_data_meta": {
            "ID": "cve@mitre.org",
            "UPDATED": "2019-01-01T23:45:00Z"
        },
        "descriptions": [
            {
                "lang": "EN",
                "value": "ACME Spy Be Gone 6.6 below have Incorrect Access Control."
            }
        ],
    "tags": [ "exclusively-hosted-service", "unsupported-when-assigned" ]
},
"ADPs": [
    {
        "provider_data_meta": {
            "ID": "user@example.com",
            "UPDATED": "2019-01-01T23:45:00Z"
        },
    "description": [
        {
            "lang": "FR",
            "value": "ACME Spy Be Gone 6.6 ci-dessous a un contrôle d'accès incorrect."
        }
    ],
    "tags": [ "other-tag-1" ]
    }
]   
```

The unsupported-when-assigned tag is only allowed to be used in the CNA container. For EOL
tagging, this ensures that the CNA making the CVE ID assignment and publishing the CVE
Record is clearly identified.

## 7 Controlling the Messaging

CNAs have expressed concern that the EOL process takes the assignment of certain
vulnerabilities out of their hands. They contend that since the affected EOL products are their
products, the CVE Program should not allow assignments for possible vulnerabilities that are not
verifiable. Vendor CNAs who have been reluctant to assign CVE IDs for EOL products may
want to reconsider. While it can be difficult to prove there is a vulnerability, using the EOL
process to make assignments gives the Vendor CNA an opportunity to communicate, to the
community and their customers, that the product is EOL and gives them another vehicle for
reaching those who need to be aware they should upgrade their fielded products. An example of a
possible message template is included below. 

    ** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** [VULN INFO HERE] We cannot prove this
    vulnerability exists. Out of an abundance of caution, this CVE ID is being assigned to
    better serve our customers and ensure all who are still running this product understand
    that the product is end of life and should be removed or upgraded. For more information
    on this, and how to upgrade, refer to the CVE Record’s reference information.

Using this approach, a vendor could justify assigning CVE IDs for all reported EOL
vulnerabilities, thus modeling proactive, customer-focused behavior. Externally, the company
looks proactive and customer focused. If the CVE ID assigned to an EOL product is later
discovered in a vulnerability scan, the description will reinforce that the product is no longer
supported, and the customer may need to take action. This approach also has the potential to
discourage the unethical practice of someone hunting for vulnerabilities in EOL products for the
purpose of boosting their professional reputation.

## 8 CVE Program EOL Process Benefits

The EOL process outlined in this document serves all CVE Program stakeholders to the degree
possible (i.e., vulnerabilities are not hidden, but consumers are made aware they should not
expect any mitigations or patches). The CVE EOL process provides another mechanism for
Vendor CNAs to communicate to customers that EOL products are not supported and customers
should upgrade to the latest version. And finally, the process is consistent with the CVE
Program’s mission to assign CVE IDs and publish CVE Records for publicly known
vulnerabilities.

## Appendix A Definitions

**CVE Participants:** Anyone who is an active participant in the CVE Program, including CVE
Board members, CNAs, Authorized Data Publishers (ADPs), and the CVE Program
Secretariat.

**CNA-LR:** The CNA-LR function must exist within each TLR hierarchy. Within that hierarchy,
the CNA-LR function assigns CVE IDs and publishes CVE Records not covered by another
CNA’s distinct, agreed upon scope.

**EOL:** For the purpose of this document, End of Life (EOL) and End of Support (EOS) are
being treated as the same, even though various vendors may use these terms differently. EOL
essentially means the vendor has decided the product in question has reached the end of its
“useful lifespan.” After this particular date, the manufacturer no longer markets, sells, provides
technical support, sustains, enhances, or fixes the product.

**Reporter:** The Reporter is the person that discovers and reports the vulnerability. It could be a
security researcher, a corporate partner, an end-user, etc.

**Top Level Root (TLR):** The highest level Root of a specific CNA hierarchy.

**Vendor:** A vendor is anyone that creates, distributes, and maintains products, regardless
of whether the product is an open source project deliverable or a commercial product.
